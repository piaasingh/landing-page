      <h1>Description</h1>
      <p>
        I am currently a third-year B.Tech student pursuing a degree in
        Information Technology (IT). My journey in the world of technology has
        been an exciting and ever-evolving one. With a passion for web
        development, I have honed my skills and knowledge in various programming
        languages and technologies. My programming journey began with languages
        like C++, C, and Python, which provided me with a strong foundation in
        computer science and problem-solving. These languages have not only
        helped me understand the fundamentals of programming but have also
        enabled me to take on a wide range of coding challenges. As a web
        development enthusiast, I have delved into the world of front-end
        development, where I've become proficient in HTML and CSS. These
        languages allow me to create visually appealing and responsive websites,
        providing users with an engaging and seamless experience. To stay
        current and continue growing as a developer, I am constantly expanding
        my skill set. Currently, I am in the process of learning React, a
        popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's
        component-based architecture and reusability have piqued my interest,
        and I am excited to explore its capabilities further. My passion for web
        development extends beyond the classroom. I have had the opportunity to
        work on various personal projects, including websites and web
        applications, which have allowed me to apply my knowledge in a practical
        context and further enhance my skills. As a student in the ever-evolving
        field of IT and a web development enthusiast, I am enthusiastic about
        the endless possibilities that technology offers. I am eager to continue
        learning and growing as a developer, taking on new challenges, and
        contributing to the exciting advancements in the world of web
        development.
